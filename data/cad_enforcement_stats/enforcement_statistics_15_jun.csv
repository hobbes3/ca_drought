Excessive Water Use Penalty Ordinance – purpose is to prohibit excessive water use when EBMUD’s Board has declared a Stage 3 or Stage 4 drought and to authorize EBMUD to impose a financial penalty on customers who disregard the mandate to conserve water during the drought water shortage conditions. Any applicable penalty charges will be reflected in customer bills beginning Sept 1, 2015 and will apply to water use in July and August 2015. 2. Water Theft Penalty Ordinance – purpose is to provide EBMUD the authority to impose administrative penalties on any person who engages in water theft, including the unauthorized use of water from a public fire hydrant or other facilities.

The WCRU investigates reports of wasteful water use and educates violators on the importance of complying with the Water Conservation Ordinance. The WCRU also catches additional violations that were not reported while patrolling neighborhoods. The first official penalty is a citation (warning) letter. Repeat violators are issued monetary fines ranging from $100-$600. Because LADWP has had an emergency water conservation ordinance with outdoor watering restrictions in effect since 2009, LADWP’s customers have been well educated for some time now on ordinance requirements. Therefore, most customers who receive a contact from the WCRU and/or a warning letter respond very well and change their habits immediately.

On July 15, 2014, the State Water Resources Control Board approved an emergency regulation to ensure that water suppliers, their customers and state residents increase water conservation in urban settings.  The emergency regulations require that all Californians stop the following activities immediately:     • Washing down driveways and sidewalks • Watering of outdoor landscapes that cause excess runoff • Using a hose to wash a motor vehicle unless the hose is fitted with a shut-off nozzle  • Using potable water in a non-circulating fountain or decorative water feature  In addition, the emergency regulations specifically require that urban water suppliers implement water shortage contingency plans to a level where restrictions on outdoor watering are mandatory.  For Yuba City, that is Stage 3 of the City’s Water Shortage Contingency Plan.    Stage 3 of the City’s Water Shortage Contingency Plan and Municipal Code Section 6-6.19, “Emergency Water Restrictions”, permit lawn watering only as follows:  • EVEN numbered addresses: Wednesdays and Saturdays  • ODD numbered addresses: Thursdays and Sundays  • New lawns may be watered three (3) times each day for the first three (3) weeks after planting provided that notification is given to the City Public Works Department of the new planting either at the time of planting or as soon thereafter as is practicable. • Public agencies and/or commercial/industrial companies using City water to irrigate large turf areas greater than 0.5 acres, shall submit an irrigation schedule for approval by the Public Works Director. This schedule shall provide for a reduction of water use based on a percentage of previous usage. The actual percentage and base year of usage shall be established by the Public Works Director as approved by the City Council and will be in accordance with the severity of the water shortage declared by the City Council. It is recommended that watering take place during the coolest parts of the day in the evening and early morning hours. As part of the City’s continued effort to help water customers comply with these water restrictions, the City has started water patrols which are designed to provide residents with conservation education.  The City’s goal is to raise awareness to the mandatory restrictions, and issue penalties as a last resort.  For those that choose not to comply with the mandatory restrictions, the following penalty schedule will apply:  1st violation: Written warning 2nd violation:  $ 50.00 surcharge* 3rd violation:  $100.00 surcharge* 4+ violations: $250.00 surcharge* per violation *Surcharges shall appear on the next monthly water billing  The Public Works Department provides complimentary water audits and will assist with adjusting sprinkler timers upon request.  If you would like to schedule a water audit or need assistance adjusting a sprinkler timer, please call John Westhouse, Water Treatment Plant Supervisor, at 530-822-4637.  Also, the City has a rebate program for the installation of smart irrigation timers.  Information on the rebate program can be found at www.yubacityh2o.com.
