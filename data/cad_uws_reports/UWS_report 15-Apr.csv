The R-GPCD for April, 2013 is 82 gpcd.  2. For the PRU and R-GPCD, applied SWRCBs recommended methodology of using billing data for the volume of water provided to residential customers in April, 2013 as a percentage of Total Monthly Potable Production (TMPP) for April, 2013 and applying that ratio to TMPP of April, 2015 to get the approximate volume of residential water use for April, 2015.

Section 28 also defines the exceptions and enforcement provisions should customers fail to comply with the prohibitions including a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1000 and the Districts authority to enforce civil and criminal action if needed. On April 28th, EBMUD Board adopted two new ordinances 1. Excessive Water Use Penalty Ordinance  purpose is to prohibit excessive water use when EBMUDs Board has declared a Stage 3 or Stage 4 drought and to authorize EBMUD to impose a financial penalty on customers who disregard the mandate to conserve water during the drought water shortage conditions. Any applicable penalty charges will be reflected in customer bills beginning Sept 1, 2015 and will apply to water use in July and August 2015. 2. Water Theft Penalty Ordinance  purpose is to provide EBMUD the authority to impose administrative penalties on any person who engages in water theft, including the unauthorized use of water from a public fire hydrant or other facilities. ","1. EBMUDs Board adopted a preliminary water shortage action plan on February 11, 2014 and updated it on May 13, 2014. The Board adopted a new water shortage emergency action plan on August 12, 2014 that includes initiatives to comply with the states emergency water conservation regulation (State Water Board Resolution 2014-0038). EBMUDs Board adopted on December 9, 2014 a declaration to increase customer water use reductions to 15% starting Jan, 2015. The Board has adopted, on April 14th, a revised Drought Management Program and declared that EBMUD has entered the critical stage in their water supply. EBMUDs Board on April 14, 2015 adopted a mandatory 20% districtwide reduction in water use with 2013 as the baseline year.

The WCRU also catches additional violations that were not reported while patrolling neighborhoods. The first official penalty is a citation (warning) letter. Repeat violators are issued monetary fines ranging from $100-$600. Because LADWP has had an emergency water conservation ordinance with outdoor watering restrictions in effect since 2009, LADWPs customers have been well educated for some time now on ordinance requirements. Therefore, most customers who receive a contact from the WCRU and/or a warning letter respond very well and change their habits immediately. This explains why LADWP has not issued many fines in recent years. To date, the WCRU has issued over 9,000 letters and citations since January 2014.

On July 15, 2014, the State Water Resources Control Board approved an emergency regulation to ensure that water suppliers, their customers and state residents increase water conservation in urban settings.  The emergency regulations require that all Californians stop the following activities immediately:      Washing down driveways and sidewalks  Watering of outdoor landscapes that cause excess runoff  Using a hose to wash a motor vehicle unless the hose is fitted with a shut-off nozzle   Using potable water in a non-circulating fountain or decorative water feature  In addition, the emergency regulations specifically require that urban water suppliers implement water shortage contingency plans to a level where restrictions on outdoor watering are mandatory.  For Yuba City, that is Stage 3 of the Citys Water Shortage Contingency Plan.    Stage 3 of the Citys Water Shortage Contingency Plan and Municipal Code Section 6-6.19, Emergency Water Restrictions, permit lawn watering only as follows:   EVEN numbered addresses: Wednesdays and Saturdays   ODD numbered addresses: Thursdays and Sundays   New lawns may be watered three (3) times each day for the first three (3) weeks after planting provided that notification is given to the City Public Works Department of the new planting either at the time of planting or as soon thereafter as is practicable.  Public agencies and/or commercial/industrial companies using City water to irrigate large turf areas greater than 0.5 acres, shall submit an irrigation schedule for approval by the Public Works Director. This schedule shall provide for a reduction of water use based on a percentage of previous usage. The actual percentage and base year of usage shall be established by the Public Works Director as approved by the City Council and will be in accordance with the severity of the water shortage declared by the City Council. It is recommended that watering take place during the coolest parts of the day in the evening and early morning hours. As part of the Citys continued effort to help water customers comply with these water restrictions, the City has started water patrols which are designed to provide residents with conservation education.  The Citys goal is to raise awareness to the mandatory restrictions, and issue penalties as a last resort.  For those that choose not to comply with the mandatory restrictions, the following penalty schedule will apply:  1st violation: Written warning 2nd violation:  $ 50.00 surcharge* 3rd violation:  $100.00 surcharge* 4+ violations: $250.00 surcharge* per violation *Surcharges shall appear on the next monthly water billing  The Public Works Department provides complimentary water audits and will assist with adjusting sprinkler timers upon request.  If you would like to schedule a water audit or need assistance adjusting a sprinkler timer, please call John Westhouse, Water Treatment Plant Supervisor, at 530-822-4637.

Stage 4 of our Water Shortage Contingency Plan eliminates the excessive rate and reduces the outdoor water allocations.

It is estimated that during the period of April through November each year, these communities experience an influx of migrant farm workers, therefore increasing the population serviced by the District substantially. The District can quantify the approx. 500 farm labor workers housed at the labor camp operated by the Housing Authority of Kern County located on Sunset Blvd. In addition to the farm labor camp, many residents provide temporary housing for migrant farm workers. This portion of the increase in population is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify but is estimated to range from 5-15%. For purposes of reporting population, the District remains conservative in its current estimate of a 5% increase in population due to migrant farm workers. The District continues its research into population fluctuations resulting from migrant farm workers in south Kern County and will update the reported populations as data become available. In addition, the estimated population within Lamont, Weedpatch and the surrounding areas receiving service from the Lamont PUD, based on 2010 census data, is estimated to be 18,290 in 2010. Using the State of California Department of Finance population increase estimates, the population within the Districts service area has increase each year between 2010 and 2015 by 1.04%, 1.93%, 0.76%, 0.30% and 0.10% respectively. The annual population increases used are for the City of Arvin which is located within 2 to 3 miles of the Communities of Lamont and Weedpatch and are demographically very similar. Based on this information, the updated population within the Districts service area is estimated to be approx. 19,988 in 2014 and 20,009 in 2015.
