The Tahoe City Public Utility District is a resort community with a very high transient and second home population. It is not equitable to use traditional methods to estimate population within our service area, as our population that uses water fluctuates monthly, weekly and daily in some cases. Instead of simply using the average population as determined by our 2010 UWMP, TCPUD has estimated monthly population relative to changes in sewer flows within our service area.  This provides a more accurate estimate of the population density using water during a given month and we have applied this data to our estimated base full time population which occurs in the month of November. The result is a more equitable distribution of monthly water use among all types of residential users, not just the relatively low full time population. The revised percent residential use data is due to our Accounting department providing a much more detailed report of residential only water use data that was not available during the initial reporting timeframes. We appreciates the States understanding that GPCD data cannot be equally compared among all urban water suppliers unless all relevant factors are taken into account.  In our case, we feel strongly that seasonal population is a very relevant factor and we have attempted to provide population data representative and telling of our seasonal population changes.  One last note, our GPCD calculation may vary slightly from the States calculated GPCD due to differences in the number of days in our meter read period versus the calendar month.  In some cases, we have normalized Total Monthly Production data due to significantly higher or lower meter read days as compared to calendar days in a month.

EMWD has an active conservation incentive program that includes rebates on water saving devices and turf replacement, and direct install programs for both indoor and outdoor water saving devices, including high efficiency clothes washers, smart controllers and high efficiency nozzles.

This is 4,300 AF more than was sold in the first six months of 2013.  ","Although there is an increase in retail production shown in June and July of 2014 compared to 2013, many factors contribute to demand.  In fiscal 2013/14, EMWD added nearly 1,700 retail water connections.  At an average demand of 0.45 AFY per connection, we would expect to see an increase in demand of 765 AFY just from new development alone.

Higher actual ET values means that plants need addition water to remain healthy.  Higher ET values also increase customer allocation under EMWDs tiered rate.

14-Jun,06/01/2014 00:00,Lamont Public Utility District,2,Yes,142.295,151.451,MG,"Explanation pertaining to ""percentage residential"" - The District now has its billing software quantifying the actual percentage residential usage rather than estimating this value.  Explanation pertaining to R-GPCD calculation - The Communities of Lamont and Weedpatch are primarily a farming community. It is estimated that during the period of April through November each year, these communities experience an influx of migrant farm workers, therefore increasing the population serviced by the District substantially.  The District can quantify the approx. 500 farm labor workers housed at the labor camp operated by the Housing Authority of Kern County.  In addition to the farm labor camp, many residents provide temporary housing for migrant farm workers.  This portion of the increase in population is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify but is estimated to range from 5-15%.  For purposes of reporting population, the District remains conservative in its current estimate of a 5% increase in population due to migrant farm workers. The District continues its research into population fluctuations resulting from migrant farm workers in south Kern County and will update the reported populations as data become available.    In addition, the estimated population within Lamont, Weedpatch and the surrounding areas receiving service from the Lamont PUD, based on 2010 census data, is estimated to be 18,290 in 2010.  Using the State of California Department of Finance population increase estimates, the population within the Districts service area has increase each year between 2010 and 2015 by 1.04%, 1.93%, 0.76%, 0.30% and 0.10% respectively. The annual population increases used are for the City of Arvin which is located within 2 to 3 miles of the Communities of Lamont and Weedpatch and are demographically very similar.    Based on this information, the updated population within the Districts service area is estimated to be approx. 19,988 in 2014 and 20,009 in 2015. Note that the actual R-GPCD for the District continues to be less than that reported because the population, as described above, is difficult to quantify.
