To provide context as EBMUD continues to face the second drought period since 2007the average R-GPCD for Nov. from 2005-2007 is 81 gpcd using metered consumption data. The R-GPCD for Nov., 2013 is 77 gpcd. 2. For the PRU and R-GPCD, applied SWRCBs recommended methodology of using billing data for the volume of water provided to residential customers in Nov., 2013 as a percentage of Total Monthly Potable Production (TMPP) for Nov., 2013 and applying that ratio to TMPP of Nov., 2015 to get the approximate volume of residential water use for Nov., 2015. The population for 2015 was calculated using 2013 ABAG projections. 3. For Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional (CII) water use, EBMUD used a methodology similar to that for calculating R-GPCD. Billing data for the volume of water provided to CII customers in Nov., 2013 as a percentage of Total Monthly Potable Production (TMPP) for Nov., 2013 was calculated, and that ratio was applied to the TMPP for Nov., 2015 to get the approximate volume of CII water use for Nov., 2015.  4. The number of Contact Follow-Ups includes the following actions: email to customer; field visit  contact with customer; field visit  door hanger; incoming call  contact with customer; outgoing call  contact with customer; outgoing call  voice message; warning letter sent.  ",1390000,57,"EBMUDs Board adopted a revised Section 28 of the Districts Regulations Governing Service to Customers on April 14, 2015. The revised Section 28 includes the States prohibitions as well as liming outside watering to before 9am and after 6pm. Section 28 also defines the exceptions and enforcement provisions should customers fail to comply with the prohibitions including a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1000 and the Districts authority to enforce civil and criminal action if needed.  On April 28th, EBMUD Board adopted two new ordinances 1. Excessive Water Use Penalty Ordinance  purpose is to prohibit excessive water use when EBMUDs Board has declared a Stage 3 or Stage 4 drought and to authorize EBMUD to impose a financial penalty on customers who disregard the mandate to conserve water during the drought water shortage conditions. Any applicable penalty charges will be reflected in customer bills beginning Sept 1, 2015 and will apply to water use in July and August 2015. 2. Water Theft Penalty Ordinance  purpose is to provide EBMUD the authority to impose administrative penalties on any person who engages in water theft, including the unauthorized use of water from a public fire hydrant or other facilities. ","EBMUDs Board adopted a preliminary water shortage action plan on February 11, 2014 and updated it on May 13, 2014. The Board adopted a new water shortage emergency action plan on August 12, 2014 that includes initiatives to comply with the states emergency water conservation regulation (State Water Board Resolution 2014-0038). EBMUDs Board adopted on December 9, 2014 a declaration to increase customer water use reductions to 15% starting Jan, 2015. The Board has adopted, on April 14th, a revised Drought Management Program and declared that EBMUD has entered the critical stage in their water supply. EBMUDs Board on April 14, 2015 adopted a mandatory 20% districtwide reduction in water use with 2013 as the baseline year. ",,MG,"847,000,000", 56.7 ,61,No Correction,San Francisco Bay,

A second violation within 12 calendar months is punishable by a penalty of $100. A third violation within 12 calendar months of the first or second violations is punishable by a penalty of $250. A fourth and any subsequent violations within 12 calendar months of the first violation are punishable by a fine of $500. In addition, the District may opt to install a water flow restrictor device.   Additionally, a Penalty Block structure was put into place on customer usage, based on customer class, in May 2015. Beginning with the billing period primarily of June 2015 usage, YLWD will assess penalties of $10 to $160 based on usage blocks above 18 units per billing period for the Residential Class. The Commercial Class will receive penalties from $25 to $400 based on usage blocks above 50 units per billing period, and the Irrigation Class will receive penalties from $65 to $1,000 per billing period based on usage blocks above 115 units.  These blocks are based on the average monthly usage of each customer class in 2013, minus the SWRCBs mandatory 36% reduction.  ","Watering is prohibited between the hours of 9am and 6pm. Watering is limited to 15 minutes per station per day. Water is prohibited when it is raining, or there is a forecasted chance of rain of 50 percent or higher. No runoff. No washing down of hard or paved surfaces. Re-circulation of water is required for water fountains. Washing of vehicles is limited to use of a hand-held house with an automatic shut-off nozzle. Stage 3 restrictions include irrigation limited to one time per week, with no irrigation on Sunday. Education and communication regarding these restrictions have been communicated to our customers in the following ways:  6 Water Waster Hotline and 10 Website Applications for customers to notify the District of water waste they observe in the community. Additionally, the City of Yorba Linda forwarded 1 call they received from residents of water waste at locations throughout the City.  Regular specialized training regarding Conservation and the Conservation Restrictions for Operations Field staff and Customer Service Staff.  Field staff assigned to Conservation Education and Investigation of Water Waste in the Community.   53 Water Conservation Ordinance First Violations have been issued. 9 Water Conservation Ordinance Second Violations have been issued- resulting in potentially $900 in fines.   Participation in MWDOCs Turf Removal Rebate Program   Partnered with the City of Yorba Linda to identify and educate customers with a history of irrigation runoff to decrease usage and pollutants entered into the stormwater system.   Implementation of a Leak Detection Program within the District. Approximately 5 leaks found this month in YLWD-maintained pipe, which have been repaired.  Additionally, due to the loss of revenue related to the Emergency Mandate of 36%, the District has raised its base fee effective on October 1, 2015 to cover the cost of providing water service. For a 1 inch meter, this amounts to approximately a $25 increase per billing period. We are encouraging customers to continue to decrease their usage to offset the increased base fee, and to help in meeting the State Emergency Mandate.

Despite hotter and dryer conditions than recorded long term averages in November, LADWP was able to meet its required 16% cumulative reduction for the month.  ",4023175,72.1,"To date, our Water Conservation Response Unit (WCRU), a.k.a. Water Cops, has issued over 10,000 letters and citations since January 2014. WCRU actively patrol Los Angeles communities and enforce the Citys Emergency Water Conservation Ordinance. The WCRU investigates reports of wasteful water use and educates violators on the importance of complying with the Water Conservation Ordinance. The WCRU also catches additional violations that were not reported while patrolling neighborhoods. The first official penalty is a citation (warning) letter. Repeat violators are issued monetary fines ranging from $100-$600. Because LADWP has had an emergency water conservation ordinance with outdoor watering restrictions in effect since 2009, LADWPs customers have been well educated for some time now on ordinance requirements. Therefore, most customers who receive a contact from the WCRU and/or a warning letter respond very well and change their habits immediately. This explains why LADWP has not issued many fines in recent years. ","The LA Mayor and City Council approved amendments to the Citys Emergency Water Conservation Ordinance Plan on June 17, 2015 to include the following new and/or stricter restrictions: no irrigation 48 hours after a rain event; 2 days per week watering schedule; requirements for the use of pool covers and restrictions on filling residential pools; and restrictions on filling decorative fountains or ponds used solely for aesthetic purposes.  In December 2014, LADWP started its WaterSmart Pilot Study, which is a behavior efficiency program that aims to educate customers on their water use and the need to conserve through focused outreach through bi-monthly Home Water Reports.  LADWP started an AMI pilot program in April 2015 which will ultimately include the installation of around 600 smart meters on targeted customers within the next 18 months.  LADWP started a Water Loss Task Force recently to evaluate various options for improving water loss control and reducing water losses in LADWPs water distribution system. LADWP also has an annual pipe replacement program to reduce leaks in LADWPs water distribution system.  Staffing for both our WCRU enforcement unit and conservation group has increased in recent months. LADWP has also doubled funding for public outreach and education on the drought.   In addition, LADWP recognizes the importance of reaching out to high water users and has implemented multiple strategies to encourage them to reduce water use. LADWP is developing short-term and long-term conservation strategies to develop better tools for targeting these customers.   In May 2015, LADWP sent water conservation letters to the top 1 percent high water users of LADWPs single-family customers (approximately 4,600 customers). These letters stressed the importance of complying with the Ordinance restrictions and provided water saving tips and rebate information to the customers.  Additionally, LADWP enrolled 2,000 of its high water using single family customers in its Home Water Use Report Pilot Program (Pilot).   On November 20, 2015, a second water conservation letter was sent to the top 1 percent water users. The letters remind these customers on the importance of reducing their water use during this drought.   LADWP will continue planning and implementing strategies to encourage water savings among high water use customers.  ",1035,AF,"3,573,286,748", 72.1 ,68,No Correction,South Coast,

For the baseline month of November 2013, 27 days elapsed between the current and prior read; however, for November 2015, 30 days elapsed between the current and prior read. To account for this three day difference, the November 2015 acre-feet prodduction was adjusted down by three days to more closely approximate the baseline conditions. The difference between the original (4094.00 AF) and adjusted (3749.53 AF) production will be added to the December 2015 production reported number.   IRWD has been experiencing significant 7% growth in service area population since the 2013 baseline year. To account for the effects of population growth on potable water production, IRWD was able to determine a growth-adjusted potable water production amount for November 2013 of 4,908 AF. The percent difference between this number and the current November 2015 production is 24%. The officially reported reduction of 18% from November 2013 does not take into account population growth and the related effects on potable water production; however, since the intent of Executive Order B-29-15 is not to hinder economic growth, it is valuable to additionally report a growth-corrected savings figure.

As the City's primary water supply source for all water customers (potable and non-potable), the City should be able to include non-potable water savings (as opposed to potable water only) in meeting its required conservation target. The water conserved by the City (potable or non-potable) all comes from the same source and provides a direct benefit to Folsom Reservoir and the water available to the state. The City only draws water from one bucket (Folsom Reservoir) through two different taps (potable and non-potable) and should be able to receive credit for reducing water use from this bucket, whether through potable or non-potable reductions. All the savings come from the same source. Based on data to date, if the City is allowed to use all water saved (because it is all from the same source), the total cumulative savings would stand at 35.2%, as opposed to 29.4% if only using potable water. For June - November 2015, total water take (potable and no-potable) from Folsom Reservoir was 16,006 AF. For June - October 2015, total water take from Folsom Reservoir was 10,374 AF. This yields a 35.2% savings of water diverted from Folsom Reservoir. ",63376,100.8,Some water waste complaints reference the same address and/or location. Formal warning action also includes mailing a postcard with current water restrictions to water users in violation of current requirements. Some of the follow-up contacts that were provided to customers were from City staff. The Water Waste Complaints noted above (65) do not include contact follow-ups noted above (87). That is why there is a difference between the two. ,"City conducted leak and loss detection of all water lines in March 2015, bid the project in May 2015 and began repairs on June 15, 2015 for approximately 100 water service lines. On June 8, 2015 the City began a $7.6 million pipeline rehabilitation project that will repair approximately 22,000 lineal feet of concrete pipeline that is leaking. This pipeline delivers raw surface water from Folsom Lake (the City's only supply source and is accounted for in Statements of Diversion and Use) to non-potable water customers in the City's water service area. The City appropriated an additional $350,000 into the Water Conservation Program for the Fiscal Year 2014-2015 budget specifically for customer rebates programs. After a majority of the $350,000 was accounted for in the first hour of the rebate offer time period, the City appropriated an additional $150,000 for these programs in the Fiscal Year 2015/2016 Budget. On June 23, 2015 City Council approved an additional appropriation of $300,000 to the customer rebate programs and City facility grass retrofit programs (for medians, parks, and City Hall), bringing the total to $800,000 since May 2015. This includes cash for grass, irrigation efficiency upgrades, high efficiency toilet rebates, high efficiency clothes washer rebates, hot water recirculating system, and lighting and landscape turf removal and irrigation system upgrades. Median ornamental turf has been cut off from potable water use. The City recently completed a well (9/1/15) and will equip the well with a pump and piping to conduct a well production test by the end of September 2015. The proposed well will be used for non-potable purposes to reduce the draw from Folsom Reservoir. If production of the well yields as planned, there will be approximately 200 gallons per minute available. Additional outreach and public information funds include an additional $20,000 for direct mailers, new drought webpage, City newsletter, and local paper advertisements regarding drought updates, conservation mandates, conservation tips, regional outreach thru the Regional Water Authority, and requirements of the Governor's Executive Order. Additional part-time staff was hired on June 1, 2015 to address water waste complaints and rebate programs. In September 2015, the City provided an additional $7,000 to the Regional Water Authority for Fall/Winter drought messaging. City staff from other Divisions will work overtime shifts and weekends to respond to the rebate programs and requirements. In the middle of June 2015, the City mailed a 2015 Drought Guide to all water customers. All of the funds described above are in a direct response to the Governor's Executive Order and the State Water Resources Control Board emergency conservation regulations. These funds, approximately $850,000, were not budgeted in fiscal year 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 and only cover the months of May and June 2015. The City also sent out a direct mailer with additional suggestions for Fall irrigation timing, including a recommendation to water once per week or to shut off sprinkler systems completely. An additional newsletter was distributed in December 1, 2015 with additional information regarding Winter watering and the opportunity to turn off irrigation completely.

On July 15, 2014, the State Water Resources Control Board approved an emergency regulation to ensure that water suppliers, their customers and state residents increase water conservation in urban settings.  The emergency regulations require that all Californians stop the following activities immediately:      Washing down driveways and sidewalks  Watering of outdoor landscapes that cause excess runoff  Using a hose to wash a motor vehicle unless the hose is fitted with a shut-off nozzle   Using potable water in a non-circulating fountain or decorative water feature  In addition, the emergency regulations specifically require that urban water suppliers implement water shortage contingency plans to a level where restrictions on outdoor watering are mandatory.  For Yuba City, that is Stage 3 of the Citys Water Shortage Contingency Plan.    Stage 3 of the Citys Water Shortage Contingency Plan and Municipal Code Section 6-6.19, Emergency Water Restrictions, permit lawn watering only as follows:   EVEN numbered addresses: Wednesdays and Saturdays   ODD numbered addresses: Thursdays and Sundays   New lawns may be watered three (3) times each day for the first three (3) weeks after planting provided that notification is given to the City Public Works Department of the new planting either at the time of planting or as soon thereafter as is practicable.  Public agencies and/or commercial/industrial companies using City water to irrigate large turf areas greater than 0.5 acres, shall submit an irrigation schedule for approval by the Public Works Director. This schedule shall provide for a reduction of water use based on a percentage of previous usage. The actual percentage and base year of usage shall be established by the Public Works Director as approved by the City Council and will be in accordance with the severity of the water shortage declared by the City Council. It is recommended that watering take place during the coolest parts of the day in the evening and early morning hours. As part of the Citys continued effort to help water customers comply with these water restrictions, the City has started water patrols which are designed to provide residents with conservation education.  The Citys goal is to raise awareness to the mandatory restrictions, and issue penalties as a last resort.  For those that choose not to comply with the mandatory restrictions, the following penalty schedule will apply:  1st violation: Written warning 2nd violation:  $ 50.00 surcharge* 3rd violation:  $100.00 surcharge* 4+ violations: $250.00 surcharge* per violation *Surcharges shall appear on the next monthly water billing  The Public Works Department provides complimentary water audits and will assist with adjusting sprinkler timers upon request.  If you would like to schedule a water audit or need assistance adjusting a sprinkler timer, please call John Westhouse, Water Treatment Plant Supervisor, at 530-822-4637.  Also, the City has a rebate program for the installation of smart irrigation timers.  Information on the rebate program can be found at www.yubacityh2o.com.       The City appreciates the conservation efforts of our water customers.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Public Works.

Percent of Residential Use: This was determined by taking billing data as a percentage of total monthly production.  Note: Previous methodology took residential billing data as a percentage of total deliveries.     Percent of Residential Use: After reviewing the software's consumption report, it was discovered that deliveries were actually representing one month prior to the listed reporting period. For example when generating the billing software consumption report for June it is actually representing May consumption.  Total Monthly Production: After reviewing the softwares production reports it was discovered that depending on the day of the week the report is pulled it may drag in a previous months production.  For example, lets say the 1st falls on a Monday its actually recording the 30th-31st production data into the following months production totals).

Issuance of penalties was not required to achieve compliance this month.,"Explanation pertaining to R-GPCD calculation - The Communities of Lamont and Weedpatch are primarily farming communities. It is estimated that during the period of April through November each year, these communities experience an influx of migrant farm workers, therefore increasing the population serviced by the District substantially. The District can quantify the approx. 500 farm labor workers housed at the labor camp operated by the Housing Authority of Kern County located on Sunset Blvd. In addition to the farm labor camp, many residents provide temporary housing for migrant farm workers. This portion of the increase in population is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify but is estimated to range from 5-15%. For purposes of reporting population, the District remains conservative in its current estimate of a 5% increase in population due to migrant farm workers. The District continues its research into population fluctuations resulting from migrant farm workers in south Kern County and will update the reported populations as data become available. In addition, the estimated population within Lamont, Weedpatch and the surrounding areas receiving service from the Lamont PUD, based on 2010 census data, is estimated to be 18,290 in 2010. Using the State of California Department of Finance population increase estimates, the population within the Districts service area has increase each year between 2010 and 2015 by 1.04%, 1.93%, 0.76%, 0.30% and 0.10% respectively. The annual population increases used are for the City of Arvin which is located within 2 to 3 miles of the Communities of Lamont and Weedpatch and are demographically very similar. Based on this information, the updated population within the Districts service area is estimated to be approx. 19,988 in 2014 and 20,009 in 2015. Note that the actual R-GPCD for the District continues to be less than that reported because the population, as described above, is difficult to quantify.",,MG,"21,845,000", 84.9 ,70,No Correction,Tulare Lake,
