The estimate is as follows. Forestry fire trucks using 300 gallons per fill filled up at least 100 time for a total 30,000 gallons.

In addition, after a discussion with our General Manager on June 16 we were instructed to consider Camp Oakes as wholesale water and deduct it from our total potable water production. Camp Oakes used 2 CCF/units of water prior to the Lake Fire and that amount was deducted from our commercial consumption (as a wholesale commercial account).

This includes cash for grass, irrigation efficiency upgrades, high efficiency toilet rebates, high efficiency clothes washer rebates, hot water recirculating system, and lighting and landscape turf removal and irrigation system upgrades. Median ornamental turf and side street ornamental turf has been cut off from potable water use. Additional outreach and public information funds include an additional $20,000 for direct mailers, new drought webpage, City newsletter, and local paper advertisements regarding drought updates, conservation mandates, conservation tips, and requirements of the Governor's Executive Order. Additional part-time staff was hired on June 1, 2015 to address water waste complaints and rebate programs. City staff from other Divisions will work overtime shifts and weekends to respond to the rebate programs and requirements. In the middle of June 2015, the City mailed a ""2015 Drought Guide"" to all water customers.  All of the funds described above are in a direct response to the Governor's Executive Order and the State Water Resources Control Board emergency conservation regulations. These funds, approximately $850,000, were not budgeted in the current fiscal year and only cover the months of May and June 2015. The City believes that state funding should be provided to those agencies that received higher conservation targets since those agencies have to carry a higher burden of the overall conservation for the state.",558509346,850472224,176.3,0.6,No Correction,Sacramento River,268.4

It is estimated that during the period of April through November each year, these communities experience an influx of migrant farm workers, therefore increasing the population serviced by the District substantially. The District can quantify the approx. 500 farm labor workers housed at the labor camp operated by the Housing Authority of Kern County located on Sunset Blvd. In addition to the farm labor camp, many residents provide temporary housing for migrant farm workers. This portion of the increase in population is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify but is estimated to range from 5-15%. For purposes of reporting population, the District remains conservative in its current estimate of a 5% increase in population due to migrant farm workers. The District continues its research into population fluctuations resulting from migrant farm workers in south Kern County and will update the reported populations as data become available. In addition, the estimated population within Lamont, Weedpatch and the surrounding areas receiving service from the Lamont PUD, based on 2010 census data, is estimated to be 18,290 in 2010.

WCRU actively patrol Los Angeles communities and enforce the Cityês Emergency Water Conservation Ordinance. The WCRU investigates reports of wasteful water use and educates violators on the importance of complying with the Water Conservation Ordinance. The WCRU also catches additional violations that were not reported while patrolling neighborhoods. The first official penalty is a citation (warning) letter. Repeat violators are issued monetary fines ranging from $100-$600. Because LADWP has had an emergency water conservation ordinance with outdoor watering restrictions in effect since 2009, LADWPês customers have been well educated for some time now on ordinance requirements. Therefore, most customers who receive a contact from the WCRU and/or a warning letter respond very well and change their habits immediately. This explains why LADWP has not issued many fines in recent years. ","The LA Mayor and City Council approved amendments to the Cityês Emergency Water Conservation Ordinance Plan on June 17, 2015 to include the following new and/or stricter restrictions: no irrigation 48 hours after a rain event; 2 days per week watering schedule; requirements for the use of pool covers and restrictions on filling residential pools; and restrictions on filling decorative fountains or ponds used solely for aesthetic purposes. In December 2014, LADWP started its WaterSmart Pilot Study, which is a behavior efficiency program that aims to educate customers on their water use and the need to conserve through focused outreach through bi-monthly Home Water Reports. These Home Water Reports detail how much water the customer is using, how they compare to homes of similar size and climate, the water reduction required to get to efficient levels, and provide customized water saving tips and rebate recommendations.  LADWP started an AMI pilot program in April 2015 which will ultimately include the installation of around 600 smart meters on targeted customers within the next 18 months.  LADWP started a Water Loss Task Force recently to evaluate various options for improving water loss control and reducing water losses in LADWPês water distribution system. The report is planned for completion in Fall 2015 and will be presented to management for approval of cost-effective actions. LADWP also has an annual pipe replacement program to reduce leaks in LADWPês water distribution system. Staffing for both our WCRU enforcement unit and conservation group has increased in recent months. LADWP has also doubled funding for public outreach and education on the drought. 23.5 million square feet of turf has been removed in LADWPês service area since our turf removal rebate program started. LAês Mayor has set a goal for LADWP to accomplish 25 million total square feet of turf removed by the end of 2015. With only 10% of the stateês population, LA is on target to meet half of the Governorês goal to remove 50 million square feet of turf. The Save the Drop Campaign continues its partnership with celebrities Steve Carell, Jaime Camil, and Moby, with new public service announcements airing on TV, cinema, and radio. In June, the Save the Drop campaign was advertised once a month in 30 daily, weekly and monthly publications. The local cable network ran the animated Drop spot 160,000 times in June. Eight movie theaters showed the animated Drop spot in individual theaters. Bus advertising included bus tails and interior cards in English and Spanish on 266 bus tails and 750 interior cards.

The City requests the May and June reported conservation numbers be corrected as submitted this month. ",68379,141.7,"August 8, 2014  Name Address City, State, Zip  Dear Water Customer,  With the third consecutive year of drought, the City of Yuba City implemented emergency water restrictions in accordance with the Cityês Water Shortage Contingency Plan per the Governorês request in January.  On July 15, 2014, the State Water Resources Control Board approved an emergency regulation to ensure that water suppliers, their customers and state residents increase water conservation in urban settings.  The emergency regulations require that all Californians stop the following activities immediately:     « Washing down driveways and sidewalks « Watering of outdoor landscapes that cause excess runoff « Using a hose to wash a motor vehicle unless the hose is fitted with a shut-off nozzle  « Using potable water in a non-circulating fountain or decorative water feature  In addition, the emergency regulations specifically require that urban water suppliers implement water shortage contingency plans to a level where restrictions on outdoor watering are mandatory.  For Yuba City, that is Stage 3 of the Cityês Water Shortage Contingency Plan.    Stage 3 of the Cityês Water Shortage Contingency Plan and Municipal Code Section 6-6.19, Emergency Water Restrictions, permit lawn watering only as follows:  « EVEN numbered addresses: Wednesdays and Saturdays  « ODD numbered addresses: Thursdays and Sundays  « New lawns may be watered three (3) times each day for the first three (3) weeks after planting provided that notification is given to the City Public Works Department of the new planting either at the time of planting or as soon thereafter as is practicable. « Public agencies and/or commercial/industrial companies using City water to irrigate large turf areas greater than 0.5 acres, shall submit an irrigation schedule for approval by the Public Works Director. This schedule shall provide for a reduction of water use based on a percentage of previous usage. The actual percentage and base year of usage shall be established by the Public Works Director as approved by the City Council and will be in accordance with the severity of the water shortage declared by the City Council. It is recommended that watering take place during the coolest parts of the day in the evening and early morning hours. As part of the Cityês continued effort to help water customers comply with these water restrictions, the City has started water patrols which are designed to provide residents with conservation education.  The Cityês goal is to raise awareness to the mandatory restrictions, and issue penalties as a last resort.  For those that choose not to comply with the mandatory restrictions, the following penalty schedule will apply:  1st violation: Written warning 2nd violation:  $ 50.00 surcharge* 3rd violation:  $100.00 surcharge* 4+ violations: $250.00 surcharge* per violation *Surcharges shall appear on the next monthly water billing  The Public Works Department provides complimentary water audits and will assist with adjusting sprinkler timers upon request.  If you would like to schedule a water audit or need assistance adjusting a sprinkler timer, please call John Westhouse, Water Treatment Plant Supervisor, at 530-822-4637.  Also, the City has a rebate program for the installation of smart irrigation timers.  Information on the rebate program can be found at www.yubacityh2o.com.       The City appreciates the conservation efforts of our water customers.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Public Works.    Sincerely,      Diana Langley City of Yuba City  Public Works Director ",,440530000,638900000,141.7,0.66,No Correction,Sacramento River,205.6
