The R-GPCD for December, 2013 is 70 gpcd.  2. For the PRU and R-GPCD, applied SWRCBs recommended methodology of using billing data for the volume of water provided to residential customers in December, 2013 as a percentage of Total Monthly Potable Production (TMPP) for December, 2013 and applying that ratio to TMPP of December, 2014 to get the approximate volume of residential water use for December, 2014.

14-Dec,12/01/2014 00:00,Monte Vista Water District,1,Yes,567.18,654.68,AF,"Service Area Population: The State Boards recommended methodology determines a non-municipal service area population by obtaining 2010 U.S. Census data and adjusting based on growth in combined single-family and multi-family residential connections. Using this method, the District has seen no population growth over the past five years. However, our records show that at least three multi-family residential complexes with 453 additional residential units have been developed in the District since 2010. Additionally, the Department of Finance estimates that the population of the city of Montclair, which is served entirely by the District and comprises two-thirds of the Districts retail service area, grew by 1.9% between 2010 and 2014. It is, therefore, more appropriate to calculate the Districts retail service area population based on known, proven, and documented growth rather than by changes in the number of residential connections. Calculation: 2010 US Census population = 53425 + 1.9% = 54460. Calculation can be cross-checked by multiplying added multi-family residential units from 2010 to 2014 (all in Montclair) by average persons per household and occupancy rate for Montclair in 2014 (Department of Finance estimates). Calculation: 453 x 3.86 = 1749 x 96.1% = 1680. Added to 2010 population of 53425 provides a 2014 est. population of 55105. As a result, 54460 appears to be a conservative estimate for District's service area population. This number is also consistent with the District's latest monitoring reports.         Percent Residential Use: The State Boards recommended methodology is to use billing data for the volume of water provided to residential customers from the previous year as a percentage of total monthly potable water production. The District originally interpreted this recommendation as taking the percentage of residential billing usage based on total billed usage and then applying this percentage to total production. However, the District has reviewed statewide reporting data and finds that other agencies have developed their residential use percentage based on total production rather than total billed usage. This method more accurately reflects the percentage of residential demand compared to all other demands in the given period, including non-revenue water uses. As we bill bimonthly, we are using discretion per the guidance in comparing total annual production to total residential consumption for Fiscal Year 2013-14. Calculation: 6628 Total Residential Consumption / 10304 Total Production = 64% Percent Residential Use.   2013 Same Month Monthly Production: In our original monitoring reports for December 2014, January 2015, and February 2015 we input inaccurate information under Last Years Monthly Production for December and 2013 Same Month Monthly Production for January and February. We cannot explain why inaccurate information for December 2013 was provided, and we apologize for our error. For January and February, we mistakenly assumed we were to be compared to the prior year rather than to calendar year 2013 data, and we apologize for our error.

On July 15, 2014, the State Water Resources Control Board approved an emergency regulation to ensure that water suppliers, their customers and state residents increase water conservation in urban settings.  The emergency regulations require that all Californians stop the following activities immediately:      Washing down driveways and sidewalks  Watering of outdoor landscapes that cause excess runoff  Using a hose to wash a motor vehicle unless the hose is fitted with a shut-off nozzle   Using potable water in a non-circulating fountain or decorative water feature  In addition, the emergency regulations specifically require that urban water suppliers implement water shortage contingency plans to a level where restrictions on outdoor watering are mandatory.  For Yuba City, that is Stage 3 of the Citys Water Shortage Contingency Plan.    Stage 3 of the Citys Water Shortage Contingency Plan and Municipal Code Section 6-6.19, Emergency Water Restrictions, permit lawn watering only as follows:   EVEN numbered addresses: Wednesdays and Saturdays   ODD numbered addresses: Thursdays and Sundays   New lawns may be watered three (3) times each day for the first three (3) weeks after planting provided that notification is given to the City Public Works Department of the new planting either at the time of planting or as soon thereafter as is practicable.  Public agencies and/or commercial/industrial companies using City water to irrigate large turf areas greater than 0.5 acres, shall submit an irrigation schedule for approval by the Public Works Director. This schedule shall provide for a reduction of water use based on a percentage of previous usage. The actual percentage and base year of usage shall be established by the Public Works Director as approved by the City Council and will be in accordance with the severity of the water shortage declared by the City Council. It is recommended that watering take place during the coolest parts of the day in the evening and early morning hours. As part of the Citys continued effort to help water customers comply with these water restrictions, the City has started water patrols which are designed to provide residents with conservation education.  The Citys goal is to raise awareness to the mandatory restrictions, and issue penalties as a last resort.  For those that choose not to comply with the mandatory restrictions, the following penalty schedule will apply:  1st violation: Written warning 2nd violation:  $ 50.00 surcharge* 3rd violation:  $100.00 surcharge* 4+ violations: $250.00 surcharge* per violation *Surcharges shall appear on the next monthly water billing  The Public Works Department provides complimentary water audits and will assist with adjusting sprinkler timers upon request.  If you would like to schedule a water audit or need assistance adjusting a sprinkler timer, please call John Westhouse, Water Treatment Plant Supervisor, at 530-822-4637.  Also, the City has a rebate program for the installation of smart irrigation timers.  Information on the rebate program can be found at www.yubacityh2o.com.

RCWD service area includes about 18,000 acres of agricultural and ranch lands, primarily vineyards, avocado, and citrus trees. Agricultural water use from July through December 2014 ranges from 24% to 34% of the District's potable water use. Additionally, the District maintains Ag/Domestic meters where one meter serves both a home and agricultural land on a parcel. Currently, this water use is all included in """"residential"""" use for the purposes of the R-GPCD, which overstates the R-GPCD. For June through December 2014, Ag/Domestic averaged 16% of total residential use. In 2011, we analyzed the amount that agriculture represent in Ag/Domestic accounts, excluded that amount, and it lowered the GPCD by approximately 12%, a substantial change. Also, for non-revenue water, we are not currently tracking """"unaccounted-for water"""" on a monthly basis; however, our 2010 UWMP shows that our historical average has been about 5% of potable water. Recently, the District has been implementing an AMR system that is lowering the percentage of unaccounted-for water, which we will track more frequently.   UPDATE: As was indicated in all of the original monthly reports submitted to SWB, the District included a significant amount of agricultural demand in its calculation of total residential demand. After further consideration, RCWD has determined that it is not appropriate to include this agricultural demand in the calculation of residential demand since the demand represents water that is produced for commercial agricultural uses and not for urban uses. Furthermore, the District has looked more closely at the population of its service area by compiling data that is more up-to-date than that which was used for the original reports, and has arrived at a more accurate determination of population.   ",166504,78.47,"RCWD maintains a Water Conservation Policy that includes fines of up to $300 per violation for water wasting. From July 2014 through December 2014, the District sent out 119 violation written notices, which includes 110 first notices, 8 second notices and 1 third notice. The District continues to inform its customers, personnel, and local agencies on reporting and responding to water waste, and plans to increase awareness in the spring when hotter months begin.","On August 15, 2014, the District's Board adopted a resolution of declaration of Stage 3, and approval of an updated Water Shortage Contingency Plan (WSCP) and Water Conservation Policy that, among other things, responds to the SWB Emergency Regulation.

The Tahoe City Public Utility District is a resort community with a very high transient and second home population. It is not equitable to use traditional methods to estimate population within our service area, as our population that uses water fluctuates monthly, weekly and daily in some cases. Instead of simply using the average population as determined by our 2010 UWMP, TCPUD has estimated monthly population relative to changes in sewer flows within our service area.  This provides a more accurate estimate of the population density using water during a given month and we have applied this data to our estimated base full time population which occurs in the month of November. The result is a more equitable distribution of monthly water use among all types of residential users, not just the relatively low full time population. The revised percent residential use data is due to our Accounting department providing a much more detailed report of residential only water use data that was not available during the initial reporting timeframes. We appreciate the States understanding that GPCD data cannot be equally compared among all urban water suppliers unless all relevant factors are taken into account.  In our case, we feel strongly that seasonal population is a very relevant factor and we have attempted to provide population data representative and telling of our seasonal population changes.  One last note, our GPCD calculation may vary slightly from the States calculated GPCD due to differences in the number of days in our meter read period versus the calendar month.  In some cases, we have normalized Total Monthly Production data due to significantly higher or lower meter read days as compared to calendar days in a month.

14-Dec,12/01/2014 00:00,Lamont Public Utility District,2,Yes,67.938,74.163,MG,"Explanation pertaining to ""percentage residential"" - During the reporting period for Dec 2014, the District's billing software, which quantifies the actual percentage residential usage, was unable at the time to quantify the percent residential and therefore the usage was estimated based on the previous month's usage rather than the actual usage.  63.65% is the actual usage for residential only.  Explanation pertaining to R-GPCD calculation - The Communities of Lamont and Weedpatch are primarily a farming community. It is estimated that during the period of April through November each year, these communities experience an influx of migrant farm workers, therefore increasing the population serviced by the District substantially.  The District can quantify the approx. 500 farm labor workers housed at the labor camp operated by the Housing Authority of Kern County.  In addition to the farm labor camp, many residents provide temporary housing for migrant farm workers.  This portion of the increase in population is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify but is estimated to range from 5-15%.  For purposes of reporting population, the District remains conservative in its current estimate of a 5% increase in population due to migrant farm workers. The District continues its research into population fluctuations resulting from migrant farm workers in south Kern County and will update the reported populations as data become available.    In addition, the estimated population within Lamont, Weedpatch and the surrounding areas receiving service from the Lamont PUD, based on 2010 census data, is estimated to be 18,290 in 2010.  Using the State of California Department of Finance population increase estimates, the population within the Districts service area has increase each year between 2010 and 2015 by 1.04%, 1.93%, 0.76%, 0.30% and 0.10% respectively. The annual population increases used are for the City of Arvin which is located within 2 to 3 miles of the Communities of Lamont and Weedpatch and are demographically very similar.    Based on this information, the updated population within the Districts service area is estimated to be approx. 19,988 in 2014 and 20,009 in 2015. Note that the actual R-GPCD for the District continues to be less than that reported because the population, as described above, is difficult to quantify.
