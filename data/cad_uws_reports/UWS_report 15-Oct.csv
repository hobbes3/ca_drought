To provide context as EBMUD continues to face the second drought period since 2007Éthe average R-GPCD for Oct from 2005-2007 is 97 gpcd using metered consumption data. The R-GPCD for Oct, 2013 is 88 gpcd. 2. For the PRU and R-GPCD, applied SWRCBÕs recommended methodology of using billing data for the volume of water provided to residential customers in Oct, 2013 as a percentage of Total Monthly Potable Production (TMPP) for Oct, 2013 and applying that ratio to TMPP of Oct, 2015 to get the approximate volume of residential water use for Oct, 2015. The population for 2015 was calculated using 2013 ABAG projections. 3. For Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional (CII) water use, EBMUD used a methodology similar to that for calculating R-GPCD. Billing data for the volume of water provided to CII customers in Oct, 2013 as a percentage of Total Monthly Potable Production (TMPP) for Oct, 2013 was calculated, and that ratio was applied to the TMPP for Oct, 2015 to get the approximate volume of CII water use for Oct, 2015.  4.

Section 28 also defines the exceptions and enforcement provisions should customers fail to comply with the prohibitions including a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1000 and the DistrictÕs authority to enforce civil and criminal action if needed.  On April 28th, EBMUD Board adopted two new ordinancesÉ 1. Excessive Water Use Penalty Ordinance Ð purpose is to prohibit excessive water use when EBMUDÕs Board has declared a Stage 3 or Stage 4 drought and to authorize EBMUD to impose a financial penalty on customers who disregard the mandate to conserve water during the drought water shortage conditions. Any applicable penalty charges will be reflected in customer bills beginning Sept 1, 2015 and will apply to water use in July and August 2015. 2. Water Theft Penalty Ordinance Ð purpose is to provide EBMUD the authority to impose administrative penalties on any person who engages in water theft, including the unauthorized use of water from a public fire hydrant or other facilities. The penalties are from excessive use penalties that were issued in October. SeptemberÕs numbers of penalties are 1516. This number wasnÕt included in the September report as there was a lag from when the actual penalty went into effect and when the numbers were available to be published.","EBMUDÕs Board adopted a preliminary water shortage action plan on February 11, 2014 and updated it on May 13, 2014.

Additionally, the City of Yorba Linda forwarded 1 call they received from residents of water waste at locations throughout the City. ¥ Regular specialized training regarding Conservation and the Conservation Restrictions for Operations Field staff and Customer Service Staff. ¥ Field staff assigned to Conservation Education and Investigation of Water Waste in the Community. ¥  123 Water Conservation Ordinance First Violations have been issued. 13 Water Conservation Ordinance Second Violations have been issued- resulting in potentially $1,300 in fines.  ¥ Participation in MWDOCÕs Turf Removal Rebate Program  ¥ Partnered with the City of Yorba Linda to identify and educate customers with a history of irrigation runoff to decrease usage and pollutants entered into the stormwater system.  ¥ Implementation of a Leak Detection Program within the District. Approximately 8 leaks found this month in YLWD-maintained pipe, which have been repaired, and notified customers of approximately 22 leaks found on the customer-maintained side of the pipe. We are following up with the customers to ensure these leaks are also fixed as soon as possible.  Additionally, due to the loss of revenue related to the Emergency Mandate of 36%, the District has raised its base fee effective on October 1, 2015 to cover the cost of providing water service. For a 1 inch meter, this amounts to approximately a $25 increase per billing period. We are encouraging customers to continue to decrease their usage to offset the increased base fee, and to help in meeting the State Emergency Mandate.

ÒWater CopsÓ, has issued over 10,000 letters and citations since January 2014. WCRU actively patrol Los Angeles communities and enforce the CityÕs Emergency Water Conservation Ordinance. The WCRU investigates reports of wasteful water use and educates violators on the importance of complying with the Water Conservation Ordinance. The WCRU also catches additional violations that were not reported while patrolling neighborhoods. The first official penalty is a citation (warning) letter. Repeat violators are issued monetary fines ranging from $100-$600. Because LADWP has had an emergency water conservation ordinance with outdoor watering restrictions in effect since 2009, LADWPÕs customers have been well educated for some time now on ordinance requirements. Therefore, most customers who receive a contact from the WCRU and/or a warning letter respond very well and change their habits immediately. This explains why LADWP has not issued many fines in recent years. ","The LA Mayor and City Council approved amendments to the CityÕs Emergency Water Conservation Ordinance Plan on June 17, 2015 to include the following new and/or stricter restrictions: no irrigation 48 hours after a rain event; 2 days per week watering schedule; requirements for the use of pool covers and restrictions on filling residential pools; and restrictions on filling decorative fountains or ponds used solely for aesthetic purposes. In December 2014, LADWP started its WaterSmart Pilot Study, which is a behavior efficiency program that aims to educate customers on their water use and the need to conserve through focused outreach through bi-monthly Home Water Reports. These Home Water Reports detail how much water the customer is using, how they compare to homes of similar size and climate, the water reduction required to get to efficient levels, and provide customized water saving tips and rebate recommendations.  LADWP started an AMI pilot program in April 2015 which will ultimately include the installation of around 600 smart meters on targeted customers within the next 18 months.  LADWP started a Water Loss Task Force recently to evaluate various options for improving water loss control and reducing water losses in LADWPÕs water distribution system. The report is planned for completion in Fall 2015 and will be presented to management for approval of cost-effective actions. LADWP also has an annual pipe replacement program to reduce leaks in LADWPÕs water distribution system.

The water conserved by the City (potable or non-potable) all comes from the same source and provides a direct benefit to Folsom Reservoir and the water available to the state. The City only draws water from one bucket (Folsom Reservoir) through two different taps (potable and non-potable) and should be able to receive credit for reducing water use from this bucket, whether through potable or non-potable reductions. All the savings come from the same source.

On June 8, 2015 the City began a $7.6 million pipeline rehabilitation project that will repair approximately 22,000 lineal feet of concrete pipeline that is leaking. This pipeline delivers raw surface water from Folsom Lake (the City's only supply source and is accounted for in Statements of Diversion and Use) to non-potable water customers in the City's water service area. The City appropriated an additional $350,000 into the Water Conservation Program for the Fiscal Year 2014-2015 budget specifically for customer rebates programs. After a majority of the $350,000 was accounted for in the first hour of the rebate offer time period, the City appropriated an additional $150,000 for these programs in the Fiscal Year 2015/2016 Budget. On June 23, 2015 City Council approved an additional appropriation of $300,000 to the customer rebate programs and City facility grass retrofit programs (for medians, parks, and City Hall), bringing the total to $800,000 since May 2015. This includes cash for grass, irrigation efficiency upgrades, high efficiency toilet rebates, high efficiency clothes washer rebates, hot water recirculating system, and lighting and landscape turf removal and irrigation system upgrades. Median ornamental turf and side street ornamental turf has been cut off from potable water use. The City recently completed a well (9/1/15) and will equip the well with a pump and piping to conduct a well production test by the end of September 2015. The proposed well will be used for non-potable purposes to reduce the draw from Folsom Reservoir. If production of the well yields as planned, there will be approximately 200 gallons per minute available. Additional outreach and public information funds include an additional $20,000 for direct mailers, new drought webpage, City newsletter, and local paper advertisements regarding drought updates, conservation mandates, conservation tips, regional outreach thru the Regional Water Authority, and requirements of the Governor's Executive Order. Additional part-time staff was hired on June 1, 2015 to address water waste complaints and rebate programs.

On July 15, 2014, the State Water Resources Control Board approved an emergency regulation to ensure that water suppliers, their customers and state residents increase water conservation in urban settings.  The emergency regulations require that all Californians stop the following activities immediately:     ¥ Washing down driveways and sidewalks ¥ Watering of outdoor landscapes that cause excess runoff ¥ Using a hose to wash a motor vehicle unless the hose is fitted with a shut-off nozzle  ¥ Using potable water in a non-circulating fountain or decorative water feature  In addition, the emergency regulations specifically require that urban water suppliers implement water shortage contingency plans to a level where restrictions on outdoor watering are mandatory.  For Yuba City, that is Stage 3 of the CityÕs Water Shortage Contingency Plan.    Stage 3 of the CityÕs Water Shortage Contingency Plan and Municipal Code Section 6-6.19, ÒEmergency Water RestrictionsÓ, permit lawn watering only as follows:  ¥ EVEN numbered addresses: Wednesdays and Saturdays  ¥ ODD numbered addresses: Thursdays and Sundays  ¥ New lawns may be watered three (3) times each day for the first three (3) weeks after planting provided that notification is given to the City Public Works Department of the new planting either at the time of planting or as soon thereafter as is practicable. ¥ Public agencies and/or commercial/industrial companies using City water to irrigate large turf areas greater than 0.5 acres, shall submit an irrigation schedule for approval by the Public Works Director. This schedule shall provide for a reduction of water use based on a percentage of previous usage. The actual percentage and base year of usage shall be established by the Public Works Director as approved by the City Council and will be in accordance with the severity of the water shortage declared by the City Council. It is recommended that watering take place during the coolest parts of the day in the evening and early morning hours. As part of the CityÕs continued effort to help water customers comply with these water restrictions, the City has started water patrols which are designed to provide residents with conservation education.  The CityÕs goal is to raise awareness to the mandatory restrictions, and issue penalties as a last resort.  For those that choose not to comply with the mandatory restrictions, the following penalty schedule will apply:  1st violation: Written warning 2nd violation:  $ 50.00 surcharge* 3rd violation:  $100.00 surcharge* 4+ violations: $250.00 surcharge* per violation *Surcharges shall appear on the next monthly water billing  The Public Works Department provides complimentary water audits and will assist with adjusting sprinkler timers upon request.  If you would like to schedule a water audit or need assistance adjusting a sprinkler timer, please call John Westhouse, Water Treatment Plant Supervisor, at 530-822-4637.  Also, the City has a rebate program for the installation of smart irrigation timers.  Information on the rebate program can be found at www.yubacityh2o.com.

Issuance of penalties was not required to achieve compliance this month.,"Explanation pertaining to R-GPCD calculation - The Communities of Lamont and Weedpatch are primarily farming communities. It is estimated that during the period of April through November each year, these communities experience an influx of migrant farm workers, therefore increasing the population serviced by the District substantially. The District can quantify the approx. 500 farm labor workers housed at the labor camp operated by the Housing Authority of Kern County located on Sunset Blvd. In addition to the farm labor camp, many residents provide temporary housing for migrant farm workers. This portion of the increase in population is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify but is estimated to range from 5-15%. For purposes of reporting population, the District remains conservative in its current estimate of a 5% increase in population due to migrant farm workers. The District continues its research into population fluctuations resulting from migrant farm workers in south Kern County and will update the reported populations as data become available. In addition, the estimated population within Lamont, Weedpatch and the surrounding areas receiving service from the Lamont PUD, based on 2010 census data, is estimated to be 18,290 in 2010. Using the State of California Department of Finance population increase estimates, the population within the DistrictÕs service area has increase each year between 2010 and 2015 by 1.04%, 1.93%, 0.76%, 0.30% and 0.10% respectively. The annual population increases used are for the City of Arvin which is located within 2 to 3 miles of the Communities of Lamont and Weedpatch and are demographically very similar. Based on this information, the updated population within the DistrictÕs service area is estimated to be approx. 19,988 in 2014 and 20,009 in 2015. Note that the actual R-GPCD for the District continues to be less than that reported because the population, as described above, is difficult to quantify.",,MG,"91,969,000","109,854,000",99.9,67.4,No Correction,Tulare Lake,119.3715-Oct,10/01/15 00:00,"Lathrop, City of ",3,Yes,101,134,MG,,19831,87.32,We received 10 complaints obsessive water usage provided 10 door hangers/flyers,We continue to provide water conservation to residence.,,MG,"101,000,000","134,000,000",87.1,53,No Correction,San Joaquin River,115.5215-Oct,10/01/15 00:00,Lee Lake Water District,2,Yes,80948,105745,CCF,"Population based on profile of general demographic characteristics, Riverside County.
