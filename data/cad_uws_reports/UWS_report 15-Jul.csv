To provide context as EBMUD continues to face the second drought period since 2007the average R-GPCD for July from 2005-2007 is 125 gpcd using metered consumption data. The R-GPCD for July, 2013 is 105 gpcd. 2. For the PRU and R-GPCD, applied SWRCBs recommended methodology of using billing data for the volume of water provided to residential customers in July, 2013 as a percentage of Total Monthly Potable Production (TMPP) for July, 2013 and applying that ratio to TMPP of July, 2015 to get the approximate volume of residential water use for July, 2015. The population for 2015 was calculated using 2013 ABAG projections. 3. For Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional (CII) water use, EBMUD used a methodology similar to that for calculating R-GPCD. Billing data for the volume of water provided to CII customers in July, 2013 as a percentage of Total Monthly Potable Production (TMPP) for July, 2013 was calculated, and that ratio was applied to the TMPP for July, 2015 to get the approximate volume of CII water use for July, 2015.

Section 28 also defines the exceptions and enforcement provisions should customers fail to comply with the prohibitions including a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1000 and the Districts authority to enforce civil and criminal action if needed. On April 28th, EBMUD Board adopted two new ordinances 1. Excessive Water Use Penalty Ordinance _ purpose is to prohibit excessive water use when EBMUDs Board has declared a Stage 3 or Stage 4 drought and to authorize EBMUD to impose a financial penalty on customers who disregard the mandate to conserve water during the drought water shortage conditions. Any applicable penalty charges will be reflected in customer bills beginning Sept 1, 2015 and will apply to water use in July and August 2015. 2. Water Theft Penalty Ordinance _ purpose is to provide EBMUD the authority to impose administrative penalties on any person who engages in water theft, including the unauthorized use of water from a public fire hydrant or other facilities. 3.

The WCRU investigates reports of wasteful water use and educates violators on the importance of complying with the Water Conservation Ordinance. The WCRU also catches additional violations that were not reported while patrolling neighborhoods. The first official penalty is a citation (warning) letter. Repeat violators are issued monetary fines ranging from $100-$600. Because LADWP has had an emergency water conservation ordinance with outdoor watering restrictions in effect since 2009, LADWPs customers have been well educated for some time now on ordinance requirements. Therefore, most customers who receive a contact from the WCRU and/or a warning letter respond very well and change their habits immediately. This explains why LADWP has not issued many fines in recent years.","The LA Mayor and City Council approved amendments to the Citys Emergency Water Conservation Ordinance Plan on June 17, 2015 to include the following new and/or stricter restrictions: no irrigation 48 hours after a rain event; 2 days per week watering schedule; requirements for the use of pool covers and restrictions on filling residential pools; and restrictions on filling decorative fountains or ponds used solely for aesthetic purposes. In December 2014, LADWP started its WaterSmart Pilot Study, which is a behavior efficiency program that aims to educate customers on their water use and the need to conserve through focused outreach through bi-monthly Home Water Reports. These Home Water Reports detail how much water the customer is using, how they compare to homes of similar size and climate, the water reduction required to get to efficient levels, and provide customized water saving tips and rebate recommendations.  LADWP started an AMI pilot program in April 2015 which will ultimately include the installation of around 600 smart meters on targeted customers within the next 18 months.  LADWP started a Water Loss Task Force recently to evaluate various options for improving water loss control and reducing water losses in LADWPs water distribution system.

Stage 3 of the Citys Water Shortage Contingency Plan and Municipal Code Section 6-6.19, ÐEmergency Water RestrictionsÓ, permit lawn watering only as follows:  Ç EVEN numbered addresses: Wednesdays and Saturdays  Ç ODD numbered addresses: Thursdays and Sundays  Ç New lawns may be watered three (3) times each day for the first three (3) weeks after planting provided that notification is given to the City Public Works Department of the new planting either at the time of planting or as soon thereafter as is practicable. Ç Public agencies and/or commercial/industrial companies using City water to irrigate large turf areas greater than 0.5 acres, shall submit an irrigation schedule for approval by the Public Works Director. This schedule shall provide for a reduction of water use based on a percentage of previous usage. The actual percentage and base year of usage shall be established by the Public Works Director as approved by the City Council and will be in accordance with the severity of the water shortage declared by the City Council. It is recommended that watering take place during the coolest parts of the day in the evening and early morning hours. As part of the Citys continued effort to help water customers comply with these water restrictions, the City has started water patrols which are designed to provide residents with conservation education.  The Citys goal is to raise awareness to the mandatory restrictions, and issue penalties as a last resort.  For those that choose not to comply with the mandatory restrictions, the following penalty schedule will apply:  1st violation: Written warning 2nd violation:  $ 50.00 surcharge* 3rd violation:  $100.00 surcharge* 4+ violations: $250.00 surcharge* per violation *Surcharges shall appear on the next monthly water billing  The Public Works Department provides complimentary water audits and will assist with adjusting sprinkler timers upon request.  If you would like to schedule a water audit or need assistance adjusting a sprinkler timer, please call John Westhouse, Water Treatment Plant Supervisor, at 530-822-4637.  Also, the City has a rebate program for the installation of smart irrigation timers.  Information on the rebate program can be found at www.yubacityh2o.com.       The City appreciates the conservation efforts of our water customers.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Public Works.

It is estimated that during the period of April through November each year, these communities experience an influx of migrant farm workers, therefore increasing the population serviced by the District substantially. The District can quantify the approx. 500 farm labor workers housed at the labor camp operated by the Housing Authority of Kern County located on Sunset Blvd. In addition to the farm labor camp, many residents provide temporary housing for migrant farm workers. This portion of the increase in population is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify but is estimated to range from 5-15%. For purposes of reporting population, the District remains conservative in its current estimate of a 5% increase in population due to migrant farm workers. The District continues its research into population fluctuations resulting from migrant farm workers in south Kern County and will update the reported populations as data become available. In addition, the estimated population within Lamont, Weedpatch and the surrounding areas receiving service from the Lamont PUD, based on 2010 census data, is estimated to be 18,290 in 2010. Using the State of California Department of Finance population increase estimates, the population within the Districts service area has increase each year between 2010 and 2015 by 1.04%, 1.93%, 0.76%, 0.30% and 0.10% respectively. The annual population increases used are for the City of Arvin which is located within 2 to 3 miles of the Communities of Lamont and Weedpatch and are demographically very similar. Based on this information, the updated population within the Districts service area is estimated to be approx. 19,988 in 2014 and 20,009 in 2015.
