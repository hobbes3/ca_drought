14-Jul,07/01/2014 00:00,Monte Vista Water District,1,Yes,1068.36,1184.8,AF,"Service Area Population: The State Boards recommended methodology determines a non-municipal service area population by obtaining 2010 U.S. Census data and adjusting based on growth in combined single-family and multi-family residential connections. Using this method, the District has seen no population growth over the past five years. However, our records show that at least three multi-family residential complexes with 453 additional residential units have been developed in the District since 2010. Additionally, the Department of Finance estimates that the population of the city of Montclair, which is served entirely by the District and comprises two-thirds of the Districts retail service area, grew by 1.9% between 2010 and 2014. It is, therefore, more appropriate to calculate the Districts retail service area population based on known, proven, and documented growth rather than by changes in the number of residential connections. Calculation: 2010 US Census population = 53425 + 1.9% = 54460. Calculation can be cross-checked by multiplying added multi-family residential units from 2010 to 2014 (all in Montclair) by average persons per household and occupancy rate for Montclair in 2014 (Department of Finance estimates). Calculation: 453 x 3.86 = 1749 x 96.1% = 1680. Added to 2010 population of 53425 provides a 2014 est. population of 55105. As a result, 54460 appears to be a conservative estimate for District's service area population. This number is also consistent with the District's latest monitoring reports.   Percent Residential Use: The State Boards recommended methodology is to use billing data for the volume of water provided to residential customers from the previous year as a percentage of total monthly potable water production. The District originally interpreted this recommendation as taking the percentage of residential billing usage based on total billed usage and then applying this percentage to total production. However, the District has reviewed statewide reporting data and finds that other agencies have developed their residential use percentage based on total production rather than total billed usage. This method more accurately reflects the percentage of residential demand compared to all other demands in the given period, including non-revenue water uses. As we bill bimonthly, we are using discretion per the guidance in comparing total annual production to total residential consumption for Fiscal Year 2013-14.

Agricultural use of water represents between 25% and 30% of the District's potable water use. Additionally, the District maintains ag/domestic meters where one meter serves both a home and agricultural land on a parcel. Currently, this water use is all included in ""residential"" use for the purposes of the GPCD, which overstates the GPCD. In 2011, we analyzed the amount that agriculture represent in ag/domestic accounts, excluded that amount, and it lowered the GPCD by approximately 12%, a substantial change.  UPDATE: As was indicated in all of the original monthly reports submitted to SWB, the District included a significant amount of agricultural demand in its calculation of total residential demand. After further consideration, RCWD has determined that it is not appropriate to include this agricultural demand in the calculation of residential demand since the demand represents water that is produced for commercial agricultural uses and not for urban uses. Furthermore, the District has looked more closely at the population of its service area by compiling data that is more up-to-date than that which was used for the original reports, and has arrived at a more accurate determination of population.

The Tahoe City Public Utility District is a resort community with a very high transient and second home population. It is not equitable to use traditional methods to estimate population within our service area, as our population that uses water fluctuates monthly, weekly and daily in some cases. Instead of simply using the average population as determined by our 2010 UWMP, TCPUD has estimated monthly population relative to changes in sewer flows within our service area.  This provides a more accurate estimate of the population density using water during a given month and we have applied this data to our estimated base full time population which occurs in the month of November. The result is a more equitable distribution of monthly water use among all types of residential users, not just the relatively low full time population. The revised percent residential use data is due to our Accounting department providing a much more detailed report of residential only water use data that was not available during the initial reporting timeframes. We appreciates the States understanding that GPCD data cannot be equally compared among all urban water suppliers unless all relevant factors are taken into account.  In our case, we feel strongly that seasonal population is a very relevant factor and we have attempted to provide population data representative and telling of our seasonal population changes.  One last note, our GPCD calculation may vary slightly from the States calculated GPCD due to differences in the number of days in our meter read period versus the calendar month.  In some cases, we have normalized Total Monthly Production data due to significantly higher or lower meter read days as compared to calendar days in a month.

Outreach efforts have included newsletter articles, e-mail messaging, and information on our website.  In July of 2014, increased focus on the drought throughout the region has prompted many customers to call in and report water waste.  EMWD is currently following up on 127 water waste violation notices.  EMWD has an active conservation incentive program that includes rebates on water saving devices and turf replacement, and direct install programs for both indoor and outdoor water saving devices, including high efficiency clothes washers, smart controllers and high efficiency nozzles.  EMWD also has a robust recycled water program.  In the first six months of 2014, EMWD sold over 19,000 AF of recycled water offsetting potable water demand.  This is 4,300 AF more than was sold in the first six months of 2013.   ","Although there is an increase in retail production shown in June and July of 2014 compared to 2013, many factors contribute to demand.  In fiscal 2013/14, EMWD added nearly 1,700 retail water connections.  At an average demand of 0.45 AFY per connection, we would expect to see an increase in demand of 765 AFY just from new development alone.  In addition, the average ET was 7.15 inches in June of 2013 and 7.79 inches in July of 2013 compared to 8.28 inches and 8.06 inches in June and July of 2014, a 3-15% increase.  Higher actual ET values means that plants need addition water to remain healthy.  Higher ET values also increase customer allocation under EMWDs tiered rate. Even with the additional customers and an increase in ET, EMWD only saw a 3.4% in in retail water production. ",-99999,NULL,3405799115,3288818453,145,0.71,No Correction,South Coast,140

14-Jul,07/01/2014 00:00,Lamont Public Utility District,2,Yes,148.136,164.017,MG,"Explanation pertaining to ""percentage residential"" - The District now has its billing software quantifying the actual percentage residential usage rather than estimating this value.  Explanation pertaining to R-GPCD calculation - The Communities of Lamont and Weedpatch are primarily a farming community. It is estimated that during the period of April through November each year, these communities experience an influx of migrant farm workers, therefore increasing the population serviced by the District substantially.  The District can quantify the approx. 500 farm labor workers housed at the labor camp operated by the Housing Authority of Kern County.  In addition to the farm labor camp, many residents provide temporary housing for migrant farm workers.  This portion of the increase in population is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify but is estimated to range from 5-15%.  For purposes of reporting population, the District remains conservative in its current estimate of a 5% increase in population due to migrant farm workers. The District continues its research into population fluctuations resulting from migrant farm workers in south Kern County and will update the reported populations as data become available.    In addition, the estimated population within Lamont, Weedpatch and the surrounding areas receiving service from the Lamont PUD, based on 2010 census data, is estimated to be 18,290 in 2010.  Using the State of California Department of Finance population increase estimates, the population within the Districts service area has increase each year between 2010 and 2015 by 1.04%, 1.93%, 0.76%, 0.30% and 0.10% respectively. The annual population increases used are for the City of Arvin which is located within 2 to 3 miles of the Communities of Lamont and Weedpatch and are demographically very similar.    Based on this information, the updated population within the Districts service area is estimated to be approx. 19,988 in 2014 and 20,009 in 2015. Note that the actual R-GPCD for the District continues to be less than that reported because the population, as described above, is difficult to quantify.
